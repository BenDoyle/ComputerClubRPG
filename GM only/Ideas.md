## Organisations

- community shared ag know shit is up, but they are mostly keeping it secret... bad for business
- occultists / amateur mystery hunters run my bookstore owner
- cultists / organised crime connected with Mayors office, who doesn't know much but it paid to look away
- police mostly on the take except one detective who has an interest in goings on
-  government (paranormal investigations) has an eye on Guelph, and Hugo 
## Places

- government research lab?
- ancient cave system is used by the cultists and by the occult team

## Compels

- Hugo
	- if there is a risky opportunity, you need to take it ("All In")
- Lawson
	- recognised as the son of the mayor, complicating the scene
- Milo
	- when faced with an impulsive or quick solution, will take it (aint got time to think)
## Notes

- the janitor and the bookstore owner know each other, and don't like each others approach (weird science vs occult)
- The bookshop owner has a loose network of occultists
- Hugo's parents were working with the government (paranormal affairs?), and were assassinated by a cult
- there is a PA agent watching Hugo
- the mayor knows about the cultists, and is in their pocket
- there are mushrooms in the tunnels, which can be refined into the drug Milo took

## 2024-09-16

- there is a "happening" at the Wooly

	- patron of the wooly freaks out, a fight ensues
	- there is some conflict
	- patron runs

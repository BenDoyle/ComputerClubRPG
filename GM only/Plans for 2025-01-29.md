- We are going to do a beagle heist!
- Do a quick prep montage (mechanic: spend 1 FP to have the equipment they need... do a scene if its unusual)
- When they return to [[Lawson]]'s room, they get a message from [[Larry]], explaining he thinks there might be a power outage again tonight, and it will be a good opportunity to pull off the heist 
- Give the players the layout, and get them to figure out how they are going to overcome the obsicles

## Vet Building

**Quiet as a Mausoleum**
- At night, the vet building is eerily quiet. Most of the staff has gone home, leaving only a skeleton crew or a few researchers working late into the night. The silence makes it easier to move undetected, but it also makes every sound feel louder. A dropped item or the beagle barking could be a dead giveaway.
- The stillness works both ways. Any noise, even something as small as the beagle scratching at its kennel, could immediately alert anyone nearby. Every move feels heightened, and the stakes are higher because there are fewer people around to cover their tracks.

**Lights Out, Shadows Everywhere**
- The power goes out, plunging the building into complete darkness. Security cameras, motion detectors, and the lights go offline, which could both help and hinder the players. On the one hand, the darkness gives the players cover for their movements, but on the other hand, the lack of lights makes it harder for them to see, navigate, and control the situation.
- The [[Security Guard]] now relies on his flashlight to navigate, making him even more dangerous as he prowls the halls with his beam. 
- Players might need to find or use their own light sources (cell phones, flashlights, etc.) in the dark. This could give them away, or worse, alert the security guard, who might spot the light from far away.
- The beagle could get spooked by the sudden darkness, especially if it's already a little agitated. It might start barking, whimpering, or even run off, making it harder for the players to keep it under control.
The Beagle Gets Frantic
- The sudden loss of power, combined with the growing tension of the heist, could cause the beagle to react unpredictably. Dogs don’t like the dark, and sudden, unexpected changes in their environment might cause the dog to become nervous, disoriented, or agitated.
- The beagle might start barking, growling, or pacing around its kennel. The players might have to calm the dog down, which could take valuable time. If the guard is nearby, this could be a serious issue—especially if the dog starts acting more erratic due to the drug they’re testing.
- The players will have to be extra gentle with the dog in the dark, and if they rush or fumble, they could accidentally hurt it or make the situation worse. The dog could also become disoriented and run off unexpectedly, forcing the players to chase it through the dark, potentially leading them into trouble.
### Zones
- **play area** 
	- this location is fenced in, but connected directly to the beagle area
	- some of the toys are a bit strange: a ball with wires coming out of it, a glass/plastic orb
	- there is a bin of toys, the beagle will enjoy anything they select
- **kennel room** 
	- this is where the beagles are kept, in separate rooms
	- there are side rooms with lab / medical equipment (some of which will seem suspect if the players choose to investigate)
	- medical equipment and supplies scattered throughout. The rooms have a sterile, cold atmosphere, and some of the equipment is state-of-the-art. The heroes might need to use some of this equipment to help with their heist (like a tranquilizer gun or medical sedation for the beagle) — but they also risk triggering alarms or leaving evidence behind if they aren't careful.
- **administration** 
	- keys to all doors are in here
	- if one of the players wants to explore, they find a note about some weird genetic research
	- there is a file on the table with the player characters application to be dog-walkers
	- there is a note on the bulletin board about [[Bill Johnson]] being a good candidate for "the experiment"
- storage closet
	- A janitor’s closet or storage room that is meticulously organized but may have a few tools, chemicals, and supplies that could be useful for the heist. 
	- If the players take anything (especially something that could be misused, like chemicals or sedatives), the janitor might notice it’s missing — or worse, someone else might see the players in the act.
- **classrooms** 
	- if the players want to do some thieving, let them make up an item they want
### Obstacles

Ask the players how they are going to navigate these ahead of time (or do flashbacks).

 - Surveillance System The university is known for its advanced research, so the building is equipped with a surveillance system. Cameras cover the kennel, admin and play area. A mistake might trigger a call to campus security, forcing the players to either escape quickly or deal with an escalating situation.

- locked door 
	- outside - vet hall (standard mechanical lock)
- locked door, internal window 
	- hall - admin (digital lock with manual overide)
- locked door 
	- admin - kennel (key is in the admin office)
- high windows 
	- kennel - outside (alarmed, but will be de-activated during power outage)
- locked door 
	- kennel - play area (digital lock, manual override)
- locked fence 
	- play area - outside (standard ring combination lock)
## Faces
- [[Security Guard]] (wanders between the vet college and other campus buildings)
- [[Shadow Isz]] (phasing in and out of the "real" world)
- **Campus safe-walk** (interested in the characters out at night with a lab dog)
## Timer
- track: O O O O
- trigger: scene in a room
- outcome: lights come up, security system triggered. if triggered, the players have one scene to vamoose. unless already taken out, they will roll sneak opposed by notice to avoid detection by [[Security Guard]] on their way out
- when one pip ids left in the timer, there is **A Sudden Power Surge**
	- The generators kick back in too strongly, causing an unexpected surge in power that temporarily overloads the building's electrical systems. This could make lights flicker and alarm systems suddenly spike back to life. Some systems reset themselves, triggering previously deactivated security features. For example: Cameras and motion sensors suddenly reboot, reactivating without warning.Magnetic doors lock down, preventing access or escape routes from being used.  
## Events
- Nearby, a group of students are staging a late-night protest over a Walmart coming to town. They’re loud, scattered, and could provide a great distraction for the players. However, they’re also unpredictable and might get curious about what the players are up to. If the players interact with the protesters (or worse, get caught in the middle of the protest), they could risk getting dragged into the mess or attracting too much attention. But, if they use the protest as a cover, it might work to their advantage.
- At an (in)appropriate time, the [[Security Guard]] will show up. The party will either need to sneak by him, or otherwise incapacitate him
- At an (in)appropriate time(s), the players will be ambushed by [[Shadow Isz]]
- The Escape
	- As the players make it to the final stretch—the exit—the power comes back on, but not fully. The lights flicker, the emergency systems are still glitching, and the backup alarm systems are re-engaging. The alarm starts to blare in parts of the building, signaling the imminent return of security protocols.
	- With only a few moments before the full security systems come back online, the players must escape immediately. The beagle is still agitated, and the guard is closing in fast. The players might need to use their Willpower or Physique to force the door open, make a final run for the exit, or even improvise a last-minute distraction to buy time.
- On the way back to campus or to see [[Larry]], party will be intercepted by campus safe walk. they will identify the beagle as a lab beagle, and ask what the party is doing out so late. roll #skill/Deceive difficulty 4. 
	- success: "what a nice group of guys" (a contact with the safe walk folks)
	- failure: "keep an eye on them" (a future complication)
## Aftermath
- After the power comes back on...
- [[Larry]] will hook up the Beagle to IV sedative with [[Bill Johnson]]'s help
- They give the dog the drugs and watch the brain scans light up... dog twitches and moans. Characters think they can see [[Shadow Isz]] in the room with them... one leaps onto one of them and hits the machine, damagin it
- [[Larry]] says he is out of ideas for the moment, this is bigger than anything he realized. 
- He reluctantly sends the characters off to meet with [[Janice]]
- Cut away to the security guard finding evidence of their heist

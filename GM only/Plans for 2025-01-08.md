- We are going to do a beagle heist!
- Do a quick prep montage (mechanic: spend 1 FP to have the equipment they need... do a scene if its unusual)
- When they return to [[Lawson]]'s room, they get a message from [[Lawrence Davis]], explaining he thinks there might be a power outage again tonight, and it will be a good opportunity to pull off the heist 
## Places
- **play area** (this location is fenced in, but connected directly to the beagle area)
- **kennel room** (this is where the beagles are kept, in separate crates)
- **administration** (if one of the players wants to explore, they find a note about some weird genetic research)
- **classrooms** (if the players want to do some theiving, let them make up an item they want)
## Faces
- [[Security Guard]] (wanders between the vet college and other campus buildings)
- [[Shadow Isz]] (phasing in and out of the "real" world)
- **Campus safe-walk** (interested in the characters out at night with a lab dog)
## Timer
- track: O O O O
- trigger: scene in a room
- outcome: lights come up, security system triggered. if triggered, the players have one scene to vamoose. unless already taken out, they will roll sneak opposed by notice to avoid detection by [[Security Guard]] on their way out
## Events
- At an (in)appropriate time, the [[Security Guard]] will show up. The party will either need to sneak by him, or otherwise incapacitate him
- At an (in)appropriate time(s), the players will be ambushed by [[Shadow Isz]]
- On the way back to campus or to see [[Lawrence Davis]], party will be intercepted by campus safe walk. they will identify the beagle as a lab beagle, and ask what the party is doing out so late. roll #skill/Deceive difficulty 4. 
	- success: "what a nice group of guys" (a contact with the safe walk folks)
	- failure: "keep an eye on them" (a future complication)

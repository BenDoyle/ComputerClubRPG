- The gang is in a dreamworld representation of reality
- [[Lawson]] and [[Hugo]] are high on [[Third Eye]], so fuck with their senses
- the steam tunnels will appear to go on forever in both directions
- they will all see some twitchy shadow movement down the hall
- have them investigate to give them a clue about the entrance: difficulty of 6
	- success means they get a clue about where the entrance is
	- failure means they don't
	- either way they are dumped into the caverns
- a jarring sensation of movement, and they are in the caverns
- its pitch black, with a phantom light behind them coming from the steam tunnels... they can see it but can't move in that direction
- there is a dim light ahead, coming from glowing moss
- they can fashion a torch of sorts from the moss that will shed light (trying a lighter will produce flame, but it will not light up the area)
- point out that the isz are discernible, but somewhat dim, as if viewed through haze
- exploring deeper, they will discover more mushrooms, and some [[Worker Isz]]
- the workers will attack. any attack in response will cause them to run, emitting a beep sound
- the beep will trigger a memory in [[Hugo]] of his parents talking about ancient tunnels, and whether they could be suitable.. the conversation ends with the beep of his parents cell phone, and the vision ends
- if players continue, they will find an open cavern where shadowy forms are gathering mushrooms
- draw the connection to the shadows they see in the "real world"
- there is a deeper beep sound, and an attack from the shadows of a [[Soldier Isz]]
- let them win in a fight, but then introduce several more
- they will (hopefully) flee into a room that seems more carved
- here they will meet [[Moloch]], who will recognise [[Milo]] 
- they will also see a large shadowy machine, with lightning bolts moving toward it
- point out that the rooms seems much brighter and clearer, despite no more light
- Moloch will advance on [[Milo]] and presumably there will be another fight
- More of the [[Soldier Isz]] will scream into the room and attack
- The heroes wake up. any consequences are gone, and converted to "rattled by nightmare"

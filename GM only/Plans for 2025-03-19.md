	- They have built a machine, which when the time is right, can be run to weaken the barrier between worlds, It draws a tremendous amount of power, which has been causing the outages
	- They have discovered a mushroom that grows at the intersection of ley lines that aids in psychic sensitivity... this is the origin of [[Third Eye]]
	- The goal is to gain allies from the other side to increase their power in this world. They think that beings from the other side can inhabit bodies from our world, and [[Third Eye]] seems to aid the process
	- objects and creatures from the other side don't last long in our world, but the opposite is not true. things from our world are more "real there", and the creatures there are hungry for our juice

	- [[Janice]] also suspects the mayor, and may make the connection with Milo seeing things, and their old friend who had a similar experience before he dissapeared
- [[Steam Tunnels]] branch out from the physical plant building, to many of the old campus buildings

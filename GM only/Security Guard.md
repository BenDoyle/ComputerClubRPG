Security guard at the [[University]]
## Aspects

**Perpetually Tired, But Always On Duty**
Description: The security guard is on his usual late-night shift and is often yawning or rubbing his eyes, but he’s still sharp when it comes to spotting anything out of the ordinary. He may seem sluggish or distracted, but when something doesn’t feel right, his instincts kick in. He’s very familiar with the building’s usual quiet at night, so anything out of place will stand out to him.
Complication: He might not immediately notice small details, but if the players do something that stands out (like knocking over a canister or opening a door the wrong way), he’ll suddenly snap to attention and start investigating.

**Routine Patrols, But Not a Robot**
Description: The security guard walks through the building in regular intervals, with his own set path. He’s predictable in that sense, and if the players time their movements right, they can avoid him. But, he's also not rigid—he’ll deviate from his path if something catches his attention, like a strange noise or a door that wasn’t closed all the way.
Complication: The guard can sometimes go off-script, which makes it harder for the players to predict when he’ll show up. If they’re counting on his schedule, his sudden deviation could throw a wrench in their plans.

**Always Carries a Flashlight and a Clipboard**
Description: The guard’s flashlight is his constant companion. He uses it to inspect the building, check on the animals, and make notes on his clipboard. The light can be useful to him when searching a dark area, but it also means that if the players are moving in the dark, they could be exposed if they get too close. He’ll also take notes about areas he's inspected, and he can be meticulous about it.
Complication: The players will need to avoid the beam of the flashlight, especially when they’re in the open. If he spots them, his first instinct will be to shine the light on them and take down notes on what he sees, which could lead to more questions. He may even try to stop them for a “casual” chat or to check what they’re carrying.

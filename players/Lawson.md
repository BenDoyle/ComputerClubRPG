### Aspects

**Stoner engineer**

**Son of the mayor**

I know a shortcut!

I'll scratch your back... you'll scratch mine

I want to see where this leads...

### Stunts  

**Cheese it!** ~Use **Drive** in place of another skill when the goal is to simply escape capture.~ +2 when using drive to overcome in a race or chase

**The Weight of Reputation.** You can use Contacts instead of Provoke to create advantages based on the fear generated by your father the mayor. The “I’ll scratch your back... you’ll scratch mine” aspect fits with this.

**Nose for Trouble**. You can use Empathy instead of Notice to ~determine your turn order in a conflict, provided you’ve gotten a chance to observe or speak to those involved for at least a few minutes beforehand during this scene.~

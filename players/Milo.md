### Aspects

**Burnt out student occultist... Shift working Cook / Philosopher occultist**

**I ain't got time to think**

Aspects Sucker For a Sob Story

[[Lawrence Davis]] knows something (evolve into the plot he's connected with)

I can see them... sometimes

### Stunts  

**I've read about this before.** You can use **Lore** on attacks against eldritch or undead horrors.

**Let him cook.** You can use **Crafts** to improvise weapons / chemical solutions / tools from mundane everyday items.

**Huh. Deja-vu**. Use **Notice** in place of another skill during a challenge, you may use **Notice** twice in the same challenge

## Consequences

### Bio 

- Was a student studying engineering at the [[University]]
- His stress led him to abuse drugs which led to nightmarish visions which caused him to dropout and find answers, including at the [[Occult Bookstore]]
- Currently works at the [[Wooly]]
- Has been talking to [[The Janitor]] about his drug experiences

### Aspects

**Burnt out student occultist... Shift working Cook / Philosopher occultist**

I can see them... sometimes

### Stunts  

**I've read about this before.** You can use **Lore** on attacks against eldritch or undead horrors.

**Let him cook.** You can use **Crafts** to improvise weapons / chemical solutions / tools from mundane everyday items.

**Huh. Deja-vu**. Use **Notice** in place of another skill during a challenge, you may use **Notice** twice in the same challenge

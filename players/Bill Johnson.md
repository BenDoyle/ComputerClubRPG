### Stunts
Emergency Field Surgery â€“  Bill can attempt emergency medical treatment (using Lore) without proper tools, negating difficulty penalties.

Because I have a calming presence, I gain +2 to rapport when dealing with frightened animals or anxious people

Once per session, i can create an advantage by improvising medical tools in the field using everyday items.

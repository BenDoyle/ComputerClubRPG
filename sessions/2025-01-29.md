- We are going to do a beagle heist!
- Do a quick prep montage (mechanic: spend 1 FP to have the equipment they need... do a scene if its unusual)
- Give the players the layout, and get them to figure out how they are going to overcome the obstacles

[[Vet College]]
### Obstacles

Ask the players how they are going to navigate these ahead of time (or do flashbacks).

- The heroes spent the day shopping and planning out the heist
- They drove to McGilvary building in [[Lawson]]'s Sunfire care
- They broke the lock to the fence with a hammer, and replaced the lock with one they bought
- (Behind the scenes, this caused the security to close in)
- The power went out, as predicted 
- [[Milo]] used a trick to lift the combination off the door, and brute forced the order
- The heroes got in, there was a racked from the dogs that brought the security closer
- [[Bill Johnson]] was able to calm the dogs, and they made a break for it with one of them
- The raced back to [[Larry]]'s lab, dosed the dog and fired up the machine

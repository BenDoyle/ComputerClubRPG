## Encounter at the Wooly
- opens at the [[Wooly]], for trivia night
- the gang beats the vet students
- Milo sees a [demon thing](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/demonic-demon-with-glowing-eyes-fiery-face-generative-ai_900101-60388.jpg) superimposed over a patron and throws his beer at the demon man
- the demon is able to "dodge" or something... in a split second he is simply standing next to the table without having seemed to pass through the intervening space
- another patron dumps his table, screaming about a demon he sees (presumably the same one), and runs from the Wooly
- The heroes give chase, and catch up with the scared student near the river
- It turns out Bill Johnson also took the drug (little green pill called third eye), and also saw demons
- He got from a dealer by the train station
- Gang walk Bill back to South residence (2 free invokes of very grateful) frosh
- Gang heads to the bus station
- There is a dude reading a book by the bus station
- they buy 3 doses of the drugs
	- the guy takes notes (he was reading dune)
